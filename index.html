							<h3>Story 4. The lucky woman</h3>
							<p>
								Alaa had to 
								<a href="http://c1.englishcollocations.com">
									make haste
								  </a>
								in order to catch the bus that was heading to the shopping mall. 
								There was no time to waste. All she wanted was to arrive before 5:00 p.m. 
								because the 
								<a href="http://c2.englishcollocations.com">
									free voucher
								  </a>
								she won in the Saudi national day last week was about to expire. 
								She had exactly two hours to get to the shopping mall so she could choose something 
								from the amazing sales in Bath and Body Works.
								Ever since COVID-19, most of the department stores and shops were offering unbelievable 
								sales as well as giving out coupons with extra discounts. They wanted to increase their 
								profits after they were hit because of COVID-19.
								Alaa loved the scented candles at Bath and Body Works. 
								She really liked the French Lavender, Midnight in Paris, 
								and Japanese Cherry Blossom scents. She would light one up and enjoy an evening filled 
								with a lovely perfumed atmosphere. However, the candles were too expensive to buy. 
								Each candle cost almost $50. Now with all the crazy discounts, and her lucky coupon, 
								she will be able to buy not just a couple of candles, but five! Alaa was so excited 
								and wished for all her friends to become as lucky as her.
